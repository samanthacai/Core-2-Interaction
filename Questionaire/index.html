    <ol>
        <li>Describe your previous experiences with coding. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed
            to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? What parts were most confusing?</li>
            <p>I've taken Core 1 Interaction last semester where we learned HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML and CSS are mostly clear to be though I don't think we went over JS thoroughly. The most confusing parts for me were the CSS grids and animations</p>
        <li>How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in
            this class to help reduce this anxiety?</li>
            <p>I am a little nervous to learn code but overall excited to be able to create websites and learn all the features more in depth. It helps to work along with the lectures.</p>
        <li>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>
            <p>I imagine it will be helpful to create my own portfolio website by hand, and maybe leaning into UI/UX design too.</p>
        <li>What text editor do you prefer to use?</li>
            <p>I used Sublime Text last semester but I don't have a preference.</p>
        <li>Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</li>
            <p>I used GitHub to store my Harmonic Collections from my Interaction last semester. I don't know much about it besides using it as a place to store <code class=""></code></p>
        <li>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this
            relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</li>
            <p>HTML is the skeleton of a website, CSS is the skin and makeup, and JavaScript is what makes the body move.</p>
        <li>Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there are six levels
            of heading tags, `h1` through `h6`).</li>
            <p>
                <h1>Noodles</h1>
                <h2>Rice</h2>
                <h3>Curry</h3>
                <h4>Penne Alla Vodka</h4>
                <h5>Pesto</h5>
                <h6>Mocha Chip</h6>
            </p>
        <li>Create an unordered list ( `ul` ) and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related
            websites. Include a paragraph ( `p` ) on each site describing why it is important to you.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="typewolf.com"></a>
                        <p>I like to use typewolf to look for font inspiration and website inspiration, I also like to read their articles on collections of different typefaces they recommend.</p></li>
                    <li><a href="behance.com"></a>
                        <p>I frequent this website because of the variety of content and articles it has. I enjoy looking through comments and how it can be interactive between user and poster.</p></li>
                </ul>
        <li>Insert an image (`img`) that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes `alt text` that
            describes the image.</li>
            <img src="images/snoopy.jpg" alt="Snoopy listening to music on casette tapes.">
        <li>Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
            You have a few ways you can approach this:
            <ul>
                <li>Look into the `iframe` tag. Hint: If using a YouTube or Vimeo video, you can copy the embed code from
                    each video’s page.</li>
                <li>Use a `video` tag, though finding the URL of a video can sometimes be tricky – do you best to download,
                    place it in your project folder, then reference its file path</li>
            </ul>
            <video>
                <source src="images/Raavi - Lazy Susan.mp4">
            </video>
        </li>
        <li>Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to
            maintain proper indentation.
            <ul>
                <li>`main` → `section` → `div` → `p` → `span`</li>
                <li>No need to fill these tags with any actual content</li>
            </ul>
            <main>
                <section>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                            
                            </span>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </section>
            </main>
        </li>
        <li>Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another
            ordered list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure
            you nest your ordered lists properly.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Hint: `pre` tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will show
                    up like that when you view the web page.</li>
