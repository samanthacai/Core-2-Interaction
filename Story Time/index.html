    <h1>Club Penguin</h1>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
        <p>I remember at six years old begging my mom to sign me up for club penguin. I asked her every day for three days. Then one day she finally said ‘yes’ and I signed up under the same “sammy8”. I was so excited to get a purple puffle and a giant igloo.</p>
    <h2>Part 2</h2>
        <p>As I logged on to the world of club penguin, I noticed that things were not very equal on the island of club penguin. Many penguins were decked out with beautiful pearls and hairstyles beyond my five-year-old imaginations. As I made my way to the clothing store, I began to search the catalogs for what I would want to buy. As I was about to purchase a pair of star sunglasses, my screen was blocked by a pop-up asking if I would like to purchase a membership.</p>
    <h2>Part 3</h2>
        <p>WHAT? I said in my head. Why the hell would I need a membership to buy a pair of star sunglasses? I then soon realized that most of my other dreams, such as a purple puffle and giant igloo, were hidden behind a paywall of $5.99 a month. I cried a bit, but wound up the courage to ask my mommy if she would pay the measly subscription price. Of course she said no. I would have to settle for less.</p>
    <h2>Part 4</h2>
        <p>So I worked as a janitor every day in Club Penguin so I could earn enough money to buy my puffle and igloo.</p>
